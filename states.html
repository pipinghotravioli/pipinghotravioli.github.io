                    <p class="titlepage"> The argument of how much power each of the states got in relation to the government was a subject of strong contention within each of the states. This tension was one of the causes of the Civil War. Because the constitution was written slightly ambiguous, states took it up to them to take their own subjective meaning. Southern states felt as if the federal government was taking away their powers and rights. 
                    <br>
                    These thoughts of the Southern States came from the voiding of nullification, which was where states would have the right to rule federal acts unconstitutional. Once nullification was taken away, the southern states felt as if they were no longer respected and compound the tensions between the south and north.</p>
